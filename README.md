# DL4H-SP24 Local Explanations For Cervical Cancer

This project is a reproduction of the work done in [Local Explanations for Cervical Cancer](https://github.com/cwayad/Local-Explanations-for-Cervical-Cancer), developed as part of the UIUC Deep Learning for Healthcare Course by Team 11: Logan Borders, Ankita Singh, and Sam Kuhbander.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
The data access information is available in the "Data" section, and all dependencies / necessary downloads are show in code.

## Usage

The checkpoints are labeled as such in the headers to make it easier for you to run, but everything has been commented out that is not necessary. 

## Data

### Accessing the Data
- **Google Drive Folder**: [Access the Data Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1AUr8BgW16UU-7XjFf8O77XAgjA27gISV)
  - Please contact Logan, Ankita, or Sam if you encounter any access issues.

## Computational Requirements

- **Hardware Used**: The dataset is small enough for computations on an 8 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3 2.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5.
- **Run Time**: Average training time is less than 2 minutes.
- **Epochs**: For logistic regression, default epochs are 100 and for MLP it is 200, unless convergence is reached earlier.
- The training for the Local explainability models took hours however and we had to sample to get them done.

## Notebooks

- **Draft Submission**: [View the Draft Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PKwgo4jP7umgGmnmTrUsIDFM1fUI6_qY?usp=share_link)
  - Instructions: Ensure you "Run all" in the notebook. The checkpoints will automatically handle data processing and model training.
