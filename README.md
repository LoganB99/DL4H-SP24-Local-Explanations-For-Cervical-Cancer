You should be able to "Run all" and our nice checkpoints will provide you with processed and balanced data, as well as trained models. The entire process is well within the required runtime. We commented out anything that is not needed.
We show you in the draft, dataset statistics, visualizations, as well as 5 trained models on both the balanced an unbalanced dataset.

Due to the results providing overwhelmingly accurate results, we will continue past the draft with interpretability models and ROAR ablations.

Thanks!
