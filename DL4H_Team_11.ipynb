        "  Cervical Cancer prediction is a prevalent and necessary problem within today's healthcare system. Specifcally, researchers are working towards identifying risk factors and potential causes for cervical cancer. Current models, however, cannot explain why a decision is made. Local explainability techniques have been developed aiming to the causes and effects of changes within a model and explain the decision-making process at an individual prediction level, but may not be applicable in every scenario, and the explanations are not always consistent or faithful. Consequently, clinicians cannot explain why a model selected a patient as low or high risk through black-box magic models.\n",
        "*   Paper explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "  The paper aims to combat the current problem of ambiguity in explainability across scenarios and analyze the existing local interpretability methods to propose methods to help clinicians determine which type of explanation models to use in a given context. Specifically, the researchers tested 5 different ML algorithms to identify the model with the highest disease predition accuracy, and then applied explainability methods to the model to identify the best practice for disease prediction. The paper then uses the predictions of the best model to generate explanations for each model across popular interpretability methods. These methods include LIME, SHAP, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations, Tree Interpreter, and Local Surrogates. Finally, each of the interpretability methods are evaluated on a set of metrics. The model found that LIME is the most robust explainability method, but no single explaination performance optimally across all metrics. Therefore, the researches suggest that clinicians should choose a method based on the setting or choose a weighted sum of metrics. This approach helps satisfy the desired explainability properties when determining patient risk in cervical cancer. As a result, the paper also recommends and influences future models to consider interpetability methods in their analysis to improve trust in the new world of generative and predictive models.\n"

        "Transferring the code and adding ablations was successful because of the heavily commented and organized code that could be split into many sections.
